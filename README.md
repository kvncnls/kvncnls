## 🚀 About Me:
I'm a part-time freelance web developer & designer, and a full-time Mechanical Designer working in the automotive industry.
I started web development when I got laid off from work and quickly fell in love with it.
There's something about solving coding problems that makes me WANT to lose sleep.

My favourite thing about web development is turning great designs into clean, semantic code.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on freelance work and Web3-related projects
- 💼 I'm open to part-time & full-time frontend web developer roles
- ✉️ I'm very active on Twitter. I post about web development and design (with the occasional tech meme 😂). I love Svelte.
